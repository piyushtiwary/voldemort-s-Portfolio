				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<h5>Shop assistant <span>at Borgin and Burkes</span> (formerly)</h5>
				<p>Tom Marvolo Riddle (31 December 1926 - 2 May 1998), later known as Lord Voldemort or, alternatively as You-Know-Who, the Dark Lord, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was an English half-blood wizard considered to have been the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard of all time. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived, often considered more powerful or equal to Albus Dumbledore. The only child and son of Tom and Merope Riddle (n√©e Gaunt), Tom was raised in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage after his father abandoned his new family on the streets of London when the influence of her magic was lifted, and his mother died moments after giving birth to and naming him after his father and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt.</p>
